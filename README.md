# Data Professional Survey Breakdown:

In this project data professionals completed a survey, based on their own experiences. The dataset was then imported into Power BI, where the data was transformed using the Power Query Editor. The data was cleaned and formatted to be more useful. For example, the salary column was captured as a range, a new column was created and the salary was averaged (after splitting the low and high values). Lastly the dashboard was created and can be viewed here.
